<p>Hello, everyone!</p>

<p>Welcome to my Blog! Iâ€™m new at this but I wanted to create a space for me to share with the world my journey pursuing a career path in Web development and also just share a bit about some of my other journeys. This blog will mainly be about my experience learning programming languages and my interest in the tech industry. I will also blog about more personal things that I have interests in like music and health and fitness.</p>

<p>My reason for creating this blog is because I, as a woman of color first and foremost who is interested in Tech have found that I never found a blog that spoke to me. I do have an interest in many things besides tech but, I wanted a place where all of my interests come together.</p>

<p>I hope youâ€™ll follow me on my journey!! ðŸ™‚</p>
