Coming from the cli project I was pretty nervous about the sinatra project. The cli project took me 3 months before I submitted it and the first month and a half was spent on just trying to come up with an idea for my project. This time around it was very different, it took me about 2 days to come up with my project idea.
	The idea was sparked by a conversation. At first, I felt intimidated by the idea but that didn’t last very long. I remembered the conversation that I had with an instructor during my cli projects about pushing past the fear and giving myself the chance to succeed. I thought to myself what’s the harm in at least giving the idea a chance. I felt to intimidated to open up my text editor so i decided to put pen to paper and create an outline.

I felt like my outline was ambitious but, unlike my past project I felt excited by how ambitious it felt and immediately started building. Any block I hit, I felt more equipped with trying to get past them. Once my database, controllers, routes, models and views were all built; I wanted to challenge myself. I decided to add some css to my project. I relied a lot on [ww3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp) and youtube tutorials. Overall, it took me a little of a month to complete which, wasn't my ideal timeline for finishing the project but it's a major improvement from my last project. I'm extremely proud of that and feel confident moving forward that, I will improve.
