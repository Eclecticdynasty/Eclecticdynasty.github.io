Box styles/ box modeling is important when considering the design and layout of a page. A box model consists of: margins, borders, padding and content. 
	Margin properties specify the width of the margin area of a box. The 'margin' property sets the margin for all four sides while the other margin properties only set their respective side.The margin area extends the border area with an empty area used to separate the element from its neighbors. Its dimensions are the margin-box width and the margin-box height. 
	The border specifies the width, color, and style of the border area of a box. These properties apply to all elements. The border area extends the padding area to the area containing the borders. It is the area inside the border edge, and its dimensions are the border-box width and the border-box height. This area depends on the size of the border that is defined by the border-width property or the shorthand border.
	Padding properties specify the width of the padding area of a box. The padding area extends to the border surrounding the padding. When the content area has a background, color, or image set on it, this will extend into the padding. The padding's dimensions are the padding-box width and the padding-box height.
	The content area is the area containing the real content of the element. It often has a background, a color or an image (in that order, an opaque image hiding the background color) and is located inside of the content edge; its dimensions are the content width or content-box width, and the content height, or content box height.
