	Coming up on my 4th month of the full stack web development program. I've been making some progress but started to feel like due to the program being online I was lacking the structure I need to make the most progress that I could.I started looking up tips for online schooling. A lot of tips were great, they suggested things likes setting up a study environment and making study playlists. The best tip I found was making a schedule.
	I've made a schedule for myself. I usually make it for two weeks at a time. I use my G-Cal to make a specific calendar for learn.co lessons. I add a certain amount of lessons that I want to complete per day and I also schedule time per day to review lessons and labs and make notes of areas that I feel that I have more difficulty with or that I feel I need to practice more. I went from sporadically completing about 10-12 lessons per week to 10 lessons a day. If you're someone who needs a bit more structure making a schedule to hold yourself accountable to. Making a schedule can really help improve your progress and discipline.
