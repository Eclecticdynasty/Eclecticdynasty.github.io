Growing up I never had an interest in a career in the tech industry. I didn't think that it was possible for me to have one. Whenever I thought about someone who works in tech; they were a computer genius who started building computers at the age of 7 or something else obviously inspired by a teen sci-fi movie.

I learned about coding in my last year of high school. My friend had started using Code Academy to learn HTML and CSS to learn how to build a website. I didn't have any idea what he was talking about so I had to check it out. I quickly joined and started the lessons and loved it. Unfortunately, with balancing school and other activities I didnt finish all of the lessons.

Fast forward to my 3rd year of college as a marketing major with a music minor.I started thinking about the future od the marketing industry and the direction it was heading in. That lead me to Digital Marketing which sparked my interest in analytics and Web Design. I started thinking about incorporating data-driven strategies into marketing courses were very traditional based. I started to seek more information on my own and looking for courses outside of my school on analytics. I didn't find any courses that I could take due to time and money constraints.

Code Academy came back to mind when I remembered that their courses were free and so I was estactic when they had a course on SQL. I started it and completed but wasn't satisfied just there I wanted to complete the course I started in high school on building a website. So I went back to learning HTML & CSS. After spending months on that off and on due to trying to balance my school work and those courses but it became hard.

I had to realize that I wasn't happy with marketing. I had to be honest with myself that I chose it as a major because it was a safe choice and at the time. I didn't know what to do, I had just left high school realizing that I didn't want to go into the law field and felt like I had to choose something. I love programming; it challenged me and intrigued. I wanted to spend my time learning more about it. Doing those lessons on Code Academy wasn't enough. I wanted to learn more. After that semester I decided to apply to another college for their IT program and for the first time since I'd started college I pursuing something I was passionate about.

I was so excited to start learning more about programming and  having someone give me insight to what programming is like in a real-life application. Up until that point, most of what I knew about programming was self-taught. I made the decision to transfer to another college instead of applying for the Flatiron school for the reason I thought that having a degree would ultimately give me the best chances of finding a job in Web Development. However, once I was in the IT program I realized that much of what I was learning about programming was outdated.I went through the process of officially no longer being a college student. Believe me, this isn't an exciting process for me nor is it a completely awful one. The only word I can use to describe it is bittersweet. I had changed majors and transferred schools to officially be an IT major.

The idea of graduating from college and not being able to apply for an entry-level web development job didn't appeal to me and so I began to do my own research as to how I can once again be self-taught. I wasn't learning about Github, Frameworks or even languages like Ruby and Javascript. So I started looking at website sources and books that would teach me. It became hard for me to balance reading those books and taking take to apply the skills I was learning while still trying to keep up with my demanding course load. After making the decision to leave College due to the cost and realizing that I wasn't going to get the education that I wanted and needed.
		
I took some time to continue to learn what I could on my own finally getting to practice the skills I was learning and decided to take my time to begin learning Java on my own without rushing through the lessons. However, I was still struggling and still am. Which is why I'm a part of the online bootcamp program now, I feel as though I had done all that I could up until a point to make myself feel as versed in the field I want to work in as I could be. Now I need to be in a program and environment in which I can learn even more and be the Web developer I want to be. When I'm learning to code or programming, it's more than me just trying to input a bunch of words in order to create a set of working lines of code. It's my way of being an artist. A part of me has been trying to release the frustrated artist in me from a young age.

That's probably what lead me to music at a young age wanting to learn the piano and the violin. I ended up settling with the violin. My favorite part of learning wasn't the playing as much as it was learning to read music. Maybe that was just my typical analytical left-brain at work but, I loved learning all the terminology and how sheet music can be translated when playing different instruments.

I see learning code as me learning to play music. It interests me how there are different languages; that are all different and similar in some ways. I love using them as my tools like an instrument to create what I see in my mind. I get to bring visuals to life using each one creating something interactive and pleasing for someone to enjoy; something that is also functional that can be improved upon and tweaked. It challenges me and brings me the fulfillment similar to that of a musician who has written their first song and laid down the instrumentation to those lyrics and played it to a crowd that enjoys their creation. It may happen more than once but still it's an exciting feeling. I keep chasing that feeling.
