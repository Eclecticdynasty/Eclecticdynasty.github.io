I would just like to start by saying this project took me so much longer than it should have. 90 percent of the reason why it took me 2 months( yep, you read that correctly 2 months!) was due to me not being able to get out of my own head. The other 10 percent was me not knowing how to get started or knowing what topic I should choose. I went through 2-3 topics before settling on the idea of making a cli that would list vacation deals from jetsetter.com. With that in mind, I just looked at the examples of other cli data gem projects that were given before watching the cli walkthrough video. I thought that would be enough of a guideline, I soon realized that was a mistake.
 
Looking back, I started with two many methods in my cli. I wanted a method for every action, 7 in total. I should have kept it simpler also I wanted to have three classes; A cli, scraper and vacation class. Once I had the interface stubbed out I moved onto scraping. That's where the big issues began. It seemed impossible for me to get the information I wanted to pull from the jetsetter site. I started to feel like I was making the process much more complicated than it had to be especially after watching the walkthrough so many times. I decided to use a site with a simpler HTML layout but couldn't find any vacation sites that I thought were simple enough. 

I felt so defeated and intimidated by the whole process. After stepping away from it for a while I deleted everything and decided to take a simpler approach. I changed my topic to books. I found a great book list on powells.com. I started by writing out what I wanted my methods to be.
* A call method: with a welcoming message for the user.
* A book list method: With an enumerable that will list the books
* A menu method: has a case statement that #gets method that will store the user's input and prompt them to enter a book number or exit.
* A goodbye method: with a goodbye message for the user

With that outline it was smooth sailing until having one small issue while scraping. A hint to everyone (http://imgur.com/a/3jIMm) that little hack really helped me out with trying to find the selector path for the information that I wanted to scrape. I also found this time around having two classes instead of three worked much better. 

**I can't belive I did it!!!** 

The anxiousness and frustration was worth it!

So much trial and error! 

I feel very proud of myself for pushing through I know with the next project I won't take so long, getting past this first hurdle(project) was the key. I feel like i've learned a lot about the way I tackle problems through this experience and what I need to change in my approach. The importance of patience and learning to stop overthinking things are valuable lessons that I can't wait to apply to future lessons and projects.
